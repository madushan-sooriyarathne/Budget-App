# Budget-App

Monthly budget organizing app created using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

This application uses your browser's local storage to store data temporarily (incomes and expenses)
so data you enter to this application will be hanging around for couple of days (even if you close the application)

This project is a example project of the [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) i'm currently following. although i have changed the code little bit as per my requirements.
(added Local Storage support, Uses ES6 Classes, etc..)
